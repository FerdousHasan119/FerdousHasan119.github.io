	<h4>Motivation for study in CSE</h4>
	<p>From my childhood I want to be an engineer. But that time I didn't know which engineer I want to be.When I grew up and play games sometimes there was some thoughts in my mind that if I could make a game or add some features on the game.So there was thouht in my mind to be a game developer. And sometimes I thought to be a programmer. Study in CSE is also quiet interesting. It's like an open field. There are many interesting things to do here. So I decided to to study in CSE and thanks to my family that they showed respect to my decision. </p>
	<h4>Future Plan</h4>
	<p>After completing my undergraduation degree I have a plan to go to in United Kingdom for higher studies.I want to join in a game developing farm like Electronic Arts or First Touch.I have two friends who are also study in CSE.We have a plan to open a Software company or IT related something.Beside this I have passion in football. If I find any opportunity to study about football coaching I will grab that opportunity.</p>
